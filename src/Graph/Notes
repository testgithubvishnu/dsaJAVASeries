# GRAPH REPRESENTATION:
-----------------------
#To represent the graph we use the following ways:

1] Adjacency List:
- We uses array of arraylist to store edges
- to find the neighbour time complexity id O(1)

2] Adjacency matrix:
 -It is not prefered because it need more space to store and
 to find neighbour nodes it need O(v) time.

3] Edge List:
-we use arraylist,linkedlist
-used in algorithm like sorting edges
-used in minimum spanning tree

4]Implicit graph:
-Already given graph

# GRAPH TRAVERSAL:
-Process of visiting each vertx in graph.
--------------------
1] Breadth First Search [BFS]:
- Queue is used for searching
- gO TO IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOUR FIRST
- Level order traversal
- Usefull to find shortest path from one vertex to another

# Applications:
1] flood fill algorithm
2] cycle detection algorithm
3] Maze generation algorithm
4]testing graph for bip

2] Depth First Search [DFS]:
-Stack is useed
- keep going to the first neighbour
